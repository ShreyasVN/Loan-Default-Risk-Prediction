## üí° Project Motivation

In the financial industry, accurately assessing the risk of loan defaults is paramount. Traditional methods can be subjective and may not capture the complex interplay of factors influencing default risk. This project was motivated by the need to develop a data-driven, objective, and highly accurate system for predicting loan defaults, thereby enabling lenders to improve their risk management practices and make more confident lending decisions.

## üíæ Dataset

The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to loan applications and borrower characteristics. This dataset includes information such as loan amount, interest rate, income, credit score, employment history, and home ownership status. The data underwent rigorous preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features, ensuring its suitability for machine learning.

## üìà Model Development

The core of this project is a machine learning model built using **XGBoost**. The model development process involved:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming the raw data, including feature scaling and encoding of categorical variables.
2.  **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most relevant features for predicting loan defaults.
3.  **Model Training:** Training the XGBoost model on the preprocessed data.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved an accuracy of 91% on the test set.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to further enhance its performance.

## üåê Deployment

The Loan Default Risk Prediction model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**. This allows users to easily input applicant data and receive instant risk predictions. The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for demonstrating the model's capabilities and making it accessible to a wider audience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The core development language.
*   **pandas:** Essential for data handling and analysis.
*   **scikit-learn:** Standard library for machine learning.
*   **XGBoost:** High-performance gradient boosting framework.
*   **Streamlit:** Simplifies web application creation and deployment.
